      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s think you were at a bar and drinking your beer with your friends. Some drunk guys started fighting next to you, and you tried to stop them. One man shot another and left the gun in your pocket. Then, the police were there, got you and some of the guys. But, the guy fired the gun had found a way to escape. They took you all into custody to reveal who shot that poor man.</description>
